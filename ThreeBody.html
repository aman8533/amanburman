                    In 2022 summer, I did a mini research on the stability in a Star-Planet-Moon three-body system. The goal of the project was to analyze the three-body problem of various star-planet-moon configurations. The project was supervised by <b> Dr Michios Sortiris, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece and Dr Stephen Wolfram. </b><br><br>
                    In the project, we have analyzed the stability of a Star-Planet-Moon three-body system. We have altered initial conditions of the particles such as mass, position and velocity in order to see how it affects chaos in the system. The concept of systems going from a state of order to chaos and from chaos to order have also been explored. 
                    We have represented the trajectories of the particles using three dimensional visualizations of the orbits which helped me to study the interactions. Extending the work that has been done to N bodies would be very beneficial as space is composed of systems of multiple bodies with complex arrangements. Additionally, we hope to extend the project 
                    by generating probabilities for the chance of a system becoming chaotic after a period of time. <br>

                    I presented my research and findings to the Wolfram team in July, 2022 and published the research paper in Wolfram Community.  <br><br>
