        <h3>
            World Science Scholars Festival @ NYC, Oct 2022
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            
            The event provided an unique opportunity to attend prfessor Brian Greene's lecture at Columbia University, Pupin Hall. It was very exciting interacting with Professor Greene, Dr Cumrun Vafa, Dr Barabara Natterson Horowitz and Dr Stephen Wolfram, attending their lectures & discussing some of the latest reasearch in the fields of astrophysics, cosmology, astrobiology and medicine. I visited Dr Shabani's Quantum Computing lab at New York University and attended Science Talks and Lab Tours at CUNY Advanced Science Research Center. Meeting all the scholars under one roof and discussing with them about our interests in academics and extracurricular activities were equally stimulating.

                    <h4>
                    Space, Time, and Matter with Dr Brian Greene, Columbia University
                    </h4>
                    This introductory course with Professor Brian Greene covers three main topics: special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. These topics represent the extremes of speed, mass, and length in nature. As humans, we experience nature in a limited way, and as much as we may believe that we know how the world works, we are limited by only a few orders of magnitude in speed, mass, and length. Our experience is also colored by the way nature behaves within those orders of magnitude. This course addresses the tension between our experience of reality and the true nature of reality. <br>
                    <h4>
                    The Computational Universe: A New Kind of Science with Professor Stephen Wolfram
                    </h4>
                    This course with Stephen Wolfram explores the computational universe. As the power of AI and machine learning, as well as our reliance on those capabilities, increases exponentially, our future may depend less upon controlling these algorithms and programs than on communicating with them in a language that they and humans can easily understand. The course examines several of Professor Wolfram’s principles, including the Principle of Computational Irreducibility and the Principle of Computational Equivalence, to help understand the importance of computational language. World Science Scholars are given  
                    access to Wolfram One to follow Professor Wolfram’s demonstrations and create their demonstration projects. <br>
                    <h4>
                    Vulnerable by Nature: A Species-Spanning Approach to Medicine with Dr Barbara Natterson-Horowitz
                    </h4>
                    Evolution has left us vulnerable to disease. But we are not alone. Almost every disease that occurs in humans can also develop in a wide range of other species: heart attacks in vultures, breast cancer in jaguars, anxiety disorder in dogs, eating disorders in gorillas. This course examines human vulnerability to disease through three very different lenses: evolutionary biology, veterinary science, and modern human medicine. Using tools and strategies from each of these fields, Scholars acquire the skills needed to critically analyze theories of disease causation and to develop their own <br> 
                    testable adaptive hypotheses. In addition to gaining scientific competencies, Scholars are asked to consider the social and cultural implications of species-spanning medicine, including the effect this perspective might have on the negative stigma associated with some human disorders. <br>
                    <h4>
                    Aristotle’s Four Forms of Causation with Dr George Ellis
                    </h4>
                    Mathematician George Ellis explores hierarchies across scales and scientific fields, such as how biology arises from physics, and uses Aristotle’s four forms of causation as a springboard to examine the roles of randomness and agency in our universe. <br>
                    <h4>
                    How Black Holes Became Real with Dr Priyamvada Natarajan, Yale University
                    </h4>
                    Astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan explains the science of supermassive black holes from their birth to how they impact the development of their galaxies. Explore the cutting-edge research being done to better understand these phenomena. <br>
