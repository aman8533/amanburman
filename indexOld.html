                            I am a passionate student interested in research at the intersection of Physics, Cosmology, and Computer science. As a Grade 11 student, I have focused on Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Further Mathematics and also used my scientific mind to pursue research under the supervision of leading scientists in astrophysics, cosmology, and natural language processing. 

                            As a World Science Scholar, I am collaborating with the other students, scientists and researchers on various real life projects. I would like to continue exploring these areas and intend to further work on string theory, quantum mechanics, black holes, gravitational wave detection with LIGO, binary star systems, and particle physics in future. 

                            I plan to study physics at the undergraduate and postgraduate level and aim to find answers to some of the unsolved mysteries related to cosmology, black holes, and quantum physics.

                            Outside of physics, I am very passionate about addressing the lack of education for underprivileged
                            children. I created an online platform (www.prepsaurus.com) providing course content on mathematics,
                            physics, and coding. I am working with NGOs and schools based in India, Middle East and Africa to deliver the content, organize live sessions and track the progress of 5000+ students through this platform.

                            I was accepted to the prestigious World Science Scholar program where 40 of the top young mathematicians and scientists are selected annually to take part in a 2-year program. Each year a cohort of high school aged students from across the globe are selected to expand their mathematical abilities by applying math to the sciences as they participate in inspiring college-level experiences led by world-renowned scientists.  Fields addressed range from astrobiology to computational programming to neuroscience. As a part of WSS, I was involved in cutting edge research alongside world-renowned scientists including Brian Greene, Stephen Wolfram, Cumrun Vafa and Suzana Herculano-Houzel among many others.
                            I have also attended following courses as a part of WSS - Space Time and Matter by Professor Brian Greene, Vulnerable By Nature: Creating Phylogeny to understand cause of various diseases by Dr Barbara Natterson-Horowitz , MD and Cardiologist, UCLA, Aristotle's Four Forms of Causation by Dr George F.R Eliis (Astrophysicist) and Computational Language by Stephen Wolfram (Renowned Computer Scientist).

                                As a president of astronomyclub at Dubai College for the last two years, I have been involved in teaching year 7 - 9 students on various topics of space and the universe every week. I have organized lesson plans, quiz and exciting workshops. Some of the topics that I have taught over the last couple of years are: Introduction to Astronomy, General Relativity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, Higgs field, Theories for the Beginning of the Universe, The Big Bang, Asteroids, Quasars, Space Telescopes, Exomoon and Spectrometry, Wormholes, The Artemis Mission etc.  <br> As a member of AAVSO and Dubai Astronomy Group, over the last few years I have developed interests in Astrophotography. I have been actively involved in taking photographs of stars, constellations, solar system objects and deep sky objects through my Meade 6-inch telescope and other more advanced telescopes.

                                Prepsaurus aims to provide high quality online course content at affordable prices. Students and teachers can supplement their learning by accessing a wide variety of online courses. We also provide access to over 20+ teachers for doubt clarification.
                                The Idea of Prepsaurus was born in 2019 while running a physical summer camp for 30+ students at Rishikesh, India. The summer camp was run in collaboration with the Udaan Foundation.

                                I organized two weeks' educational enrichment camp to work with <b>Udaan Foundation</b> and raised funds for underprivileged students in India.
                                The students who took part in a 2-week long summer camp could not afford education. This was followed by a few camps organized in India and Rwanda. I am currently working actively with an NGO, Transform Schools and created STEM curriculum for underprivileged students. I have constructed and delivered a syllabus for Scratch, robotics, coding and artificial intelligence and signed an MOU with Transform Schools, to deliver STEM and coding courses for 5000 underprivileged children over the next 1 year.

                                Prepsaurus is very happy to associate with a school in Rwanda where 500+ students are going to use the platform. I have partnered with Fawe Gahini in Rwanda to work alongside students and the school management to deliver the content of Prepsaurus. With more than 5000+ users on this platform now, our student base is growing everyday. I am looking to scale this beyond India and Africa.I have recently connected with Plan Canada and the UN to reach out to more audience accross the globe. I am also using this platform to disseminate knowledge on various advanced concepts in physics: special relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, blackholes, gravitational waves, exoplanets/colonizing the universe.
